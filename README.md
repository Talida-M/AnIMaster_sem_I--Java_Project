When I tested my application, I utilized Postman, a popular API testing tool, and configured Swagger to enhance the overall testing and documentation experience. Postman allowed me to easily send HTTP requests to various endpoints, simulate different scenarios, and inspect the responses, ensuring that my application's APIs functioned correctly. Additionally, by configuring Swagger, I was able to provide a user-friendly and interactive API documentation interface, making it easier for developers and testers to understand and interact with the API endpoints, view request examples, and test various functionalities effectively
